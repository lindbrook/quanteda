\title{Calculate keyness statistics}
\usage{
textstat_keyness(x, target = 1L, measure = c("chi2", "exact", "lr", "pmi"),
  sort = TRUE, correction = c("default", "yates", "williams", "none"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{dfm} containing the features to be examined for keyness}

\item{target}{the document index (numeric, character or logical) identifying 
the document forming the "target" for computing keyness; all other 
documents' feature frequencies will be combined for use as a reference}

\item{measure}{(signed) association measure to be used for computing keyness.
Currently available: \code{"chi2"}; \code{"exact"} (Fisher's exact test); 
\code{"lr"} for the likelihood ratio; \code{"pmi"} for pointwise mutual 
information.}

\item{sort}{logical; if \code{TRUE} sort features scored in descending order 
of the measure, otherwise leave in original feature order}

\item{correction}{if \code{"default"}, Yates correction is applied to 
\code{"chi2"}; William's correction is applied to \code{"lr"}; and no 
correction is applied for the \code{"exact"} and \code{"pmi"} measures. 
Specifying a value other than the default can be used to override the 
defaults, for instance to apply the Williams correction to the chi2 
measure.  Specifying a correction for the \code{"exact"} and \code{"pmi"} 
measures has no effect and produces a warning.}
}
\value{
a data.frame of computed statistics and associated p-values, where 
  the features scored name each row, and the number of occurrences for both 
  the target and reference groups. For \code{measure = "chi2"} this is the 
  chi-squared value, signed positively if the observed value in the target 
  exceeds its expected value; for \code{measure = "exact"} this is the 
  estimate of the odds ratio; for \code{measure = "lr"} this is the 
  likelihood ratio \eqn{G2} statistic; for \code{"pmi"} this is the pointwise
  mutual information statistics.

\code{textstat_keyness} returns a data.frame of features and
  their keyness scores and frequency counts.
}
\description{
Calculate "keyness", a score for features that occur differentially across 
different categories.  Here, the categories are defined by reference to a
"target" document index in the \link{dfm}, with the reference group
consisting of all other documents.

\examples{
# compare pre- v. post-war terms using grouping
period <- ifelse(docvars(data_corpus_inaugural, "Year") < 1945, "pre-war", "post-war")
mydfm <- dfm(data_corpus_inaugural, groups = period)
head(mydfm) # make sure 'post-war' is in the first row
head(result <- textstat_keyness(mydfm), 10)
tail(result, 10)

# compare pre- v. post-war terms using logical vector
mydfm2 <- dfm(data_corpus_inaugural)
textstat_keyness(mydfm2, docvars(data_corpus_inaugural, "Year") >= 1945)

# compare Trump 2017 to other post-war preseidents
pwdfm <- dfm(corpus_subset(data_corpus_inaugural, period == "post-war"))
head(textstat_keyness(pwdfm, target = "2017-Trump"), 10)
# using the likelihood ratio method
head(textstat_keyness(dfm_smooth(pwdfm), measure = "lr", target = "2017-Trump"), 10)
