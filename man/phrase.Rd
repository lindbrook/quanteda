\title{Declare a compound character to be a sequence of separate pattern matches}
\usage{
phrase(x)

is.phrase(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the sequence, as a \code{character} object containing whitespace 
separating the patterns}
}
\value{
\code{phrase} returns a specially classed list whose white-spaced 
  elements have been parsed into separate \code{character} elements.

\code{is.phrase} returns \code{TRUE} if the object was created by 
  \code{\link{phrase}}; \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
Declares that a whitespace-separated expression consists of multiple 
patterns, separated by whitespace.  This is typically used as a wrapper 
around \code{\link{pattern}} to make it explicit that the pattern elements 
are to be used for matches to multi-word sequences, rather than individual,
unordered matches to single words.
}
\examples{
# make phrases from characters
phrase(c("a b", "c d e", "f"))

# from a dictionary
phrase(dictionary(list(catone = c("a b"), cattwo = "c d e", catthree = "f")))

# from a collocations object
(coll <- textstat_collocations(tokens("a b c a b d e b d a b")))
phrase(coll)
